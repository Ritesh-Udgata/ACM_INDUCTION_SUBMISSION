I don't know how to run server side code non-locally. Please download this, and follow the steps to see it in action:
1. Download and Extract somewhere
2. click nodeServer. Right click and open in Integrated Terminal
3. type "nodemon index.js"
4. open the index.html file on the local host or use shortcut alt + b to see the html file in action.
